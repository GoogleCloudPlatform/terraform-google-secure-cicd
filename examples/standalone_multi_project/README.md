# Standalone Multi Project CI/CD example

This end to end example showcases the [`secure-ci`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-secure-cicd/tree/main/modules/secure-ci) and [`secure-cd`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-secure-cicd/tree/main/maodules/secure-cd) modules working together to create a secure software build and deploy pipeline, which is able to deploy to target environments in multiple projects. This example also deploys the [`cloudbuild-private-pool`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-secure-cicd/tree/main/modules/cloudbuild-private-pool) and [`workerpool-gke-ha-vpn`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-secure-cicd/tree/main/modules/workerpool-gke-ha-vpn) modules to enable deploying to private GKE clusters from Cloud Build.

This example also creates GKE clusters and accompanying VPC networks for sample target environments in multiple separate projects for simplified deployment and demonstration purposes.
